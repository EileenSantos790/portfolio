            <span>I’m passionate about coding because it allows me to turn ideas into real, working solutions. I enjoy
                the
                analytical process of breaking down complex problems and finding creative, efficient ways to solve them.
                Coding constantly challenges me to learn, improve, and think differently. I also value the collaborative
                side of development — sharing ideas, building with others, and seeing how teamwork can create something
                greater than the sum of its parts.</span>
